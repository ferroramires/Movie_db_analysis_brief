# Movie_db_brief

This project analysed various factors that might lead to higher revenues and "success" for movies. The data set is comprised of the data from movies released between 1960 and 2015.

I decided to explored factors that led to higher revenues, such as the movie's genre, budget and if most made a profit or had a loss.
